# Theming Bootstrap

<ContentsSidebar>

[[toc]]

</ContentsSidebar>
<div class="lead mb-5">

Theming is accomplished by SASS variables, SASS maps, and custom CSS. There is no dedicated theme stylesheet; instead, you can enable the built-in theme to add gradients, shadows, and more.

</div>

<script setup lang="ts">
    import ContentsSidebar from '../../components/ContentsSidebar.vue'
</script>
