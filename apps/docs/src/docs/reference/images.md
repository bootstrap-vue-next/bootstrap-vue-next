# Image Support

The `src` prop and `blank-src` prop, out of the box, works only with absolute or fully-qualified-domain-name URLs. If you are using project assets as image sources, please refer to [Asset URL handling](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-vue/tree/main/packages/plugin-vue#asset-url-handling) to configure Vite to transform asset urls. If using a different build tool, you will need to find the relevant documentation to transform assets.
