# Badge

<div class="lead mb-5">

Documentation and examples for badges, our small count and labeling component.

</div>

## Examples

Badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative font sizing and em units. As of v5, badges no longer have focus or hover styles for links.

### Headings

<<< DEMO ./demo/BadgeHeadings.vue#template{vue-html}

### Buttons

Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter.

<<< DEMO ./demo/BadgeButtons.vue#template{vue-html}
Note that depending on how they are used, badges may be confusing for users of screen readers and similar assistive technologies. While the styling of badges provides a visual cue as to their purpose, these users will simply be presented with the content of the badge. Depending on the specific situation, these badges may seem like random additional words or numbers at the end of a sentence, link, or button.

Unless the context is clear (as with the “Notifications” example, where it is understood that the “4” is the number of notifications), consider including additional context with a visually hidden piece of additional
text.

### Positioned

Use the `placement` property to position it relative to a parent [link](/docs/components/link) or [button](/docs/components/button).
Note that for links of buttons, you haveto manually apply the `postition-relative` class to the badge's parent,
unlike with [`Avatars`](/docs/components/avatar) where that is hanlded automatically.

<<< DEMO ./demo/BadgePositioned.vue#template{vue-html}

### Dot Indicator

The `Badge` component also implements a `dot-indicator` property to transform the badge into
a more generic indicator. Please note that you have to manually apply the `position-relative`
class to the parent button.

<<< DEMO ./demo/BadgeDotIndicator.vue#template{vue-html}

## Background colors

<<< DEMO ./demo/BadgeBackgroundColors.vue#template{vue-html}
::: tip Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies – such as screen readers. Ensure that information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text hidden with the `.visually-hidden` class.

::: warning Interactions between Variant props
`BBadge` implements `bg-variant` and `text-variant` to provide finer control of colors, they take
precedence over the `variant` prop. See the
[Color Variant Reference](/docs/reference/color-variants#variant-interactions) for details.

## Pill badges

Use the `pill` prop to make badges more rounded with a larger border-radius.
<<< DEMO ./demo/BadgePill.vue#template{vue-html}

## Actionable badges

Quickly provide actionable badges by specifying either the `href` prop (links) or `to` prop (router-links):

<<< DEMO ./demo/BadgeActionable.vue#template{vue-html}

<ComponentReference :data="data" />

<script lang="ts">
import {data} from '../../data/components/badge.data'

export default {
  setup() {
    return {data}
  }
}
</script>
