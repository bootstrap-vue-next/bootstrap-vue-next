# Tables

<PageHeader>

For displaying tabular data, `BTable` supports pagination, filtering, sorting, custom rendering, various style options, events, and asynchronous data. For simple display of tabular data without all the fancy features, BootstrapVueNext provides two lightweight alternative components [`BTableLite`](light-weight-tables) and [`BTableSimple`](simple-tables).

</PageHeader>

## Basic Usage

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableOverview.vue

## Items (record data)

`items` is the table data in array format, where each record (row) data are keyed objects. Example
format:

<<< FRAGMENT ./demo/TableItems.ts#snippet{ts}

`<BTable>` automatically samples the first row to extract field names (the keys in the record
data). Field names are automatically "humanized" by converting `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, and
`camelCase` to individual words and capitalizes each word. Example conversions:

- `first_name` becomes `First Name`
- `last-name` becomes `Last Name`
- `age` becomes `Age`
- `YEAR` remains `YEAR`
- `isActive` becomes `Is Active`

These titles will be displayed in the table header, in the order they appear in the **first** record
of data. See the [Fields](#fields-column-definitions) section below for customizing how field
headings appear.

::: info NOTE
Field order is not guaranteed. Fields will typically appear in the order they were defined
in the first row, but this may not always be the case depending on the version of browser in use.
See section [Fields (column definitions)](#fields-column-definitions) below to see how to guarantee
the order of fields, and to override the headings generated.
:::

Record data may also have additional special reserved name keys for colorizing rows and individual
cells (variants), and for triggering additional row detail. The type [TableItem](/docs/types#tableitem)
defines the supported optional item record modifier properties
(make sure your field keys do not conflict with these names):

| Property        | Type                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_cellVariants` | Partial<Record<keyof T, ColorVariant>> | Bootstrap contextual state applied to individual cells. Keyed by field (See the [Color Variants](/docs/reference/color-variants) for supported values). These variants map to classes `table-${variant}` or `bg-${variant}` (when the `dark` prop is set). |
| `_rowVariant`   | ColorVariant                           | Bootstrap contextual state applied to the entire row (See the [Color Variants](/docs/reference/color-variants) for supported values). These variants map to classes `table-${variant}` or `bg-${variant}` (when the `dark` prop is set)                    |
| `_showDetails`  | boolean                                | Used to trigger the display of the `row-details` scoped slot. See section [Row details support](#row-details-support) below for additional information                                                                                                     |

### Example: Using variants for table cells

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableCellVariants.vue

`items` can also be a reference to a _provider_ function, which returns an `Array` of items data.
Provider functions can also be asynchronous:

- By returning `null` (or `undefined`) and calling a callback, when the data is ready, with the data
  array as the only argument to the callback,
- By returning a `Promise` that resolves to an array.

See the ["Using Items Provider functions"](#using-items-provider-functions) section below for more
details.

### Table item notes and warnings

- Avoid manipulating record data in place, as changes to the underlying items data will cause either
  the row or entire table to be re-rendered. See [Primary Key](#primary-key), below, for ways to
  minimize Vue's re-rendering of rows.
- `items` array records should be a simple object and **must** avoid placing data that may have
  circular references in the values within a row. `<BTable>` serializes the row data into strings
  for sorting and filtering, and circular references will cause stack overflows to occur and your
  app to crash!

## Fields (column definitions)

The `fields` prop is used to customize the table columns headings, and in which order the columns of
data are displayed. The field object keys (i.e. `age` or `first_name` as shown below) are used to
extract the value from each item (record) row, and to provide additional features such as enabling
[sorting](#sorting) on the column, etc.

Fields can be provided as a _simple array_ or an _array of objects_. **Internally the fields data
will be normalized into the _array of objects_ format**. Events or slots that include the column
`field` data will be in the normalized field object format (array of objects for `fields`, or an
object for an individual `field`).

### Fields as a simple array

Fields can be a simple array, for defining the order of the columns, and which columns to display:

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableFieldArray.vue

### Fields as an array of objects

Fields can be a an array of objects, providing additional control over the fields (such as sorting,
formatting, etc.). Only columns (keys) that appear in the fields array will be shown:

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableFieldObjects.vue

### Field Definition Reference

The following field properties (defined as [TableField](/docs/types#tableitem)) are recognized:

| Property            | Type                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Notes:**

- Field properties, if not present, default to `null` (falsey) unless otherwise stated above.
- `class`, `thClass`, `tdClass` etc. will not work with classes that are defined in scoped CSS,
  unless you are using Vue's

## Primary Key

`<BTable>` provides an additional prop `primary-key`, which you can use to identify the _name_ of
the field key that _uniquely_ identifies the row.

The value specified by the primary column key **must be** either a `string` or `number`, and **must
be unique** across all rows in the table.

The primary key column does not need to appear in the displayed fields.

### Table row ID generation

When provided, the `primary-key` will generate a unique ID for each item row `<tr>` element. The ID
will be in the format of `{table-id}__row_{primary-key-value}`, where `{table-id}` is the unique ID
of the `<BTable>` and `{primary-key-value}` is the value of the item's field value for the field
specified by `primary-key`.

### Table render and transition optimization

The `primary-key` is also used by `<BTable>` to help Vue optimize the rendering of table rows.
Internally, the value of the field key specified by the `primary-key` prop is used as the Vue `:key`
value for each rendered item row `<tr>` element.

If you are seeing rendering issue (i.e. tooltips hiding or unexpected subcomponent re-usage when
item data changes or data is sorted/filtered/edited) or table row transitions are not working,
setting the `primary-key` prop (if you have a unique identifier per row) can alleviate these issues.

Specifying the `primary-key` column is handy if you are using 3rd party table transitions or drag
and drop plugins, as they rely on having a consistent and unique per row `:key` value.

If `primary-key` is not provided, `<BTable>` will auto-generate keys based on the displayed row's
index number (i.e. position in the _displayed_ table rows). This may cause GUI issues such as sub
components/elements that are rendering with previous results (i.e. being re-used by Vue's render
patch optimization routines). Specifying a `primary-key` column can alleviate this issue (or you can
place a unique `:key` on your element/components in your custom formatted field slots).

Refer to the [Table body transition support](#table-body-transition-support) section for additional
details.

## Table Style Options

### Table styling

`<BTable>` provides several props to alter the style of the table:

| prop                 | Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Row styling and attributes

You can also style every row using the `tbody-tr-class` prop, and optionally supply additional attributes via the `tbody-tr-attr` prop:

| Property         | Type                                                                                            | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `tbody-tr-class` | `((item: Items \| null, type: TableRowType) => TableStrictClassValue) \| TableStrictClassValue` | Classes to be applied to every row on the table.    |
| `tbody-tr-attr`  | `((item: Items \| null, type: TableRowType) => AttrsValue) \| AttrsValue`                       | Attributes to be applied to every row on the table. |

When passing a function reference to `tbody-tr-class` or `tbody-tr-attr`, the function's arguments
will be as follows:

- `item` - The item record data associated with the row. For rows that are not associated with an
  item record, this value will be `null` or `undefined`
- `type` - The type of row being rendered ([TableRowType](/docs/types#tablefield)). `'row'` for an item row, `'row-details'` for an item
  details row, `'row-top'` for the fixed row top slot, `'row-bottom'` for the fixed row bottom slot,
  or `'table-busy'` for the table busy slot.

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableRowStyles.vue

### Responsive tables

Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease. Make any table responsive
across all viewports by setting the prop `responsive` to `true`. Or, pick a maximum breakpoint with
which to have a responsive table up to by setting the prop `responsive` to one of the breakpoint
values: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, or `xl`.

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableResponsive.vue

**Responsive table notes:**

- _Possible vertical clipping/truncation_. Responsive tables make use of `overflow-y: hidden`, which
  clips off any content that goes beyond the bottom or top edges of the table. In particular, this
  may clip off dropdown menus and other third-party widgets.
- Using props `responsive` and `fixed` together will **not** work as expected. Fixed table layout
  uses the first row (table header in this case) to compute the width required by each column (and
  the overall table width) to fit within the width of the parent container &mdash; without taking
  cells in the `<tbody>` into consideration &mdash; resulting in table that may not be responsive.
  To get around this limitation, you would need to specify widths for the columns (or certain
  columns) via one of the following methods:
  - Use `<col>` elements within the [`table-colgroup` slot](#table-colgroup) that have widths set
    (e.g. `<col style="width: 20rem">`), or
  - Wrap header cells in `<div>` elements, via the use of
    [custom header rendering](#header-and-footer-custom-rendering-via-scoped-slots), which have a
    minimum width set on them, or
  - Use the `thStyle` property of the [field definition object](#field-definition-reference) to set
    a width for the column(s), or
  - Use custom CSS to define classes to apply to the columns to set widths, via the `thClass` or
    `class` properties of the [field definition object](#field-definition-reference).

### Stacked tables

An alternative to responsive tables, BootstrapVue includes the stacked table option (using custom
SCSS/CSS), which allow tables to be rendered in a visually stacked format. Make any table stacked
across _all viewports_ by setting the prop `stacked` to `true`. Or, alternatively, set a breakpoint
at which the table will return to normal table format by setting the prop `stacked` to one of the
breakpoint values `'sm'`, `'md'`, `'lg'`, or `'xl'`.

Column header labels will be rendered to the left of each field value using a CSS `::before` pseudo
element, with a width of 40%.

The `stacked` prop takes precedence over the [`sticky-header`](#sticky-headers) prop and the
[`stickyColumn`](#sticky-columns) field definition property.

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableStacked.vue

**Note: When the table is visually stacked:**

- The table header (and table footer) will be hidden.
- Custom rendered header slots will not be shown, rather, the fields' `label` will be used.
- The table **cannot** be sorted by clicking the rendered field labels. You will need to provide an
  external control to select the field to sort by and the sort direction. See the
  [Sorting](#sorting) section below for sorting control information, as well as the
  [complete example](#complete-example) at the bottom of this page for an example of controlling
  sorting via the use of form controls.
- The slots `top-row` and `bottom-row` will be hidden when visually stacked.
- The table caption, if provided, will always appear at the top of the table when visually stacked.
- In an always stacked table, the table header and footer, and the fixed top and bottom row slots
  will not be rendered.

BootstrapVueNext's custom CSS is required in order to support stacked tables.

### Table caption

Add an optional caption to your table via the prop `caption` or the named slot `table-caption` (the
slot takes precedence over the prop). The default Bootstrap v4 styling places the caption at the
bottom of the table:

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableCaption.vue

You can have the caption placed at the top of the table by setting the `caption-top` prop to `true`:

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableCaptionTop.vue

You can also use [custom CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caption-side) to
control the caption positioning.

### Table colgroup

<NotYetImplemented /> The `table-colgroup` slot is not yet implemented.

### Table busy state

`<BTable>` provides a `busy` model that will flag the table as busy, which you can set to `true`
just before you update your items, and then set it to `false` once you have your items. When in the
busy state, the table will have the attribute `aria-busy="true"`.

During the busy state, the table will be rendered in a "muted" look (`opacity: 0.55`), using the
following custom CSS:

<<< FRAGMENT ./demo/TableBusy.css#snippet{css}

#### table-busy slot

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableBusy.vue

Also see the [Using Items Provider Functions](#using-items-provider-functions) below for additional
information on the `busy` state.

**Notes:**

- All click related and hover events, and sort-changed events will **not** be emitted when the table
  is in the `busy` state.
- Busy styling and slot are not available in the `<BTableLite>` component.

## Custom data rendering

Custom rendering for each data field in a row is possible using either
[scoped slots](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html#scoped-slots) or a formatter callback
function, or a combination of both.

### Scoped field slots

Scoped field slots give you greater control over how the record data appears. You can use scoped
slots to provided custom rendering for a particular field. If you want to add an extra field which
does not exist in the records, just add it to the [`fields`](#fields-column-definitions) array, and
then reference the field(s) in the scoped slot(s). Scoped field slots use the following naming
syntax: `` `'cell(${field_key})'` ``.

You can use the default _fall-back_ scoped slot `'cell()'` to format any cells that do not have an
explicit scoped slot provided.

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableCustomData.vue

The slot's scope variable (`data` in the above sample) will have the following properties:

| Property         | Type                               | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index`          | number                             | The row number (indexed from zero) relative to the _displayed_ rows                                                                                                       |
| `item`           | Items                              | The entire raw record data (i.e. `items[index]`) for this row (before any formatter is applied)                                                                           |
| `value`          | unknown                            | The value for this key in the record (`null` or `undefined` if a virtual column), or the output of the field's [`formatter` function](#formatter-callback)                |
| `unformatted`    | unknown                            | The raw value for this key in the item record (`null` or `undefined` if a virtual column), before being passed to the field's [`formatter` function](#formatter-callback) |
| `field`          | `(typeof computedFields.value)[0]` | The field's normalized field definition object                                                                                                                            |
| `detailsShowing` | boolean                            | Will be `true` if the row's `row-details` scoped slot is visible. See section [Row details support](#row-details-support) below for additional information                |
| `toggleDetails`  | `() => void`                       | Can be called to toggle the visibility of the rows `row-details` scoped slot. See section [Row details support](#row-details-support) below for additional information    |
| `rowSelected`    | boolean                            | Will be `true` if the row has been selected. See section [Row select support](#row-select-support) for additional information                                             |
| `selectRow`      | `(index?: number) => void`         | When called, selects the current row. See section [Row select support](#row-select-support) for additional information                                                    |
| `unselectRow`    | `(index?: number) => void`         | When called, unselects the current row. See section [Row select support](#row-select-support) for additional information                                                  |

**Notes:**

- `index` will not always be the actual row's index number, as it is computed after filtering,
  sorting and pagination have been applied to the original table data. The `index` value will refer
  to the **displayed row number**. This number will align with the indexes from the optional
  [`v-model` bound](#v-model-binding) variable.
- When using the `v-slot` syntax, note that slot names **cannot** contain spaces, and
  when using in-browser DOM templates the slot names will _always_ be lower cased. To get around
  this, you can pass the slot name using Vue's
  [dynamic slot names](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/slots.html#dynamic-slot-names)

#### Displaying raw HTML

By default `BTable` escapes HTML tags in items data and results of formatter functions, if you need
to display raw HTML code in `BTable`, you should use `v-html` directive on an element in a in
scoped field slot.

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableRawHtml.vue

::: danger WARNING
Be cautious of using the <code>v-html</code> method to display user
supplied content, as it may make your application vulnerable to
<a class="alert-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">

<a class="alert-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_sanitization">sanitize</a> the
user supplied string.
:::

### Formatter callback

Optionally, you can customize field output by using a formatter callback function. To enable this,
the field's `formatter` property is used. The value of this property may be String or function
reference. In case of a String value, the function must be defined at the parent component's
methods. When providing `formatter` as a `Function`, it must be declared at global scope (window or
as global mixin at Vue, or as an anonymous function), unless it has been bound to a `this` context.

The callback function accepts three arguments - `value`, `key`, and `item`, and should return the
formatted value as a string (HTML strings are not supported)

## Sorting

As mentioned in the [Fields](#fields) section above, you can make columns
sortable in `<BTable>`. Clicking on a sortable column header will sort the column in ascending
direction (smallest first), while clicking on it again will switch the direction of sorting to
descending (largest first). Clicking on it a third time will stop sorting on the column. For
single column sorting (e.g. `multisort===false`) clicking on a differnt sortable column header will
sort that column in ascending order and clear the sort order for the previously sorted column.

You can control which column is pre-sorted and the order of sorting (ascending or descending). To
pre-specify the column to be sorted use the `sortBy` model. For single column sorting (e.g. `multisort===false`)
`sortBy` should be an array containing a single `BTableSortBy` object.

<<< FRAGMENT ./demo/TableSortBy.ts#snippet{ts}

- **Ascending**: Items are sorted lowest to highest (i.e. `A` to `Z`) and will be displayed with the
  lowest value in the first row with progressively higher values in the following rows.
- **Descending**: Items are sorted highest to lowest (i.e. `Z` to `A`) and will be displayed with
  the highest value in the first row with progressively lower values in the following rows.

By default the comparer function does a `numeric localeCompare`. If one wishes to change this, use a custom comparer function with that `BTableSortBy` element.

To prevent the table from wiping out the comparer function, internally it will set the `order` key to `undefined`, instead of just removing the element from the `sortBy` array. i.e. `:sort-by="[]"` & `:sort-by="[key: 'someKey', order: undefined]"` behave identically. Naturally if this value is given to a server, orders of undefined should be handled.

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableSort.vue

`sorbBy` is a [named model](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model.html#multiple-v-model-bindings)
so it can be bound to an object that will be updated with the current sort state when the user changes
sorting by clicking the headers.

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableSortBy.vue

Tables can be sorted by multiple columns. Programmaticly, this can be done by adding more entries
to the `sortBy` array. From the user inteface, multi-sort works as follows:

- Clicking on a sortable header that isn't currently sorted adds it as `ascending` to the end of the sortBy list
- Clicking on a sortable header that is currently sorted as ascending makes it **descending**, but leaves it in the same order in the `sortBy` list
- Clicking on a sortable header that is currently sorted as descending will set the order to undefined. If `must-sort` is `true` OR if `mustSort` is an array that contains that columns `key`, it will skip to be `ascending`

## Simple tables

The `BTableSimple` component gives the user complete control over the rendering of the table content, while providing basic Bootstrap v5 table styling. `BTableSimple` is a wrapper component around the `<table>` element. Inside the component, via the default slot, you can use any or all of the BootstrapVueNext table helper components: `BThead`, `BTfoot`, `BTbody`, `BTr`, `BTh`, `BTd`, and the HTML5 elements `<caption>`, `<colgroup>` and `<col>`. Contrary to the component's name, one can create simple or complex table layouts with `BTableSimple`.

`BTableSimple` provides basic styling options via props: striped, bordered, borderless, outlined, small, hover, dark, fixed, responsive and sticky-header. Note that stacked mode is available but requires some additional markup to generate the cell headings, as described in the Simple tables and stacked mode section below. Sticky columns are also supported, but also require a bit of additional markup to specify which columns are to be sticky. See below for more information on using sticky columns.

Since b-table-simple is just a wrapper component, of which you will need to render content inside, it does not provide any of the advanced features of `BTable` (i.e. row events, head events, sorting, pagination, filtering, foot-clone, items, fields, etc.).

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableSimpleOverview.vue#template{vue-html}

When in responsive or sticky-header mode, the `<table>` element is wrapped inside a `<div>` element. If you need to apply additional classes or attributes to the `<table>` element, use the table-classes and table-attrs, respectively.

### Simple tables and stacked mode

A bit of additional markup is required on your `BTableSimple` body cells when the table is in stacked mode. Specifically, BootstrapVueNext uses a special data attribute to create the cell's heading, of which you can supply to `BTd` or `BTh` via the stacked-heading prop. Only plain strings are supported (not HTML markup), as we use the pseudo element ::before and css content property.

Here is the same table as above, set to be always stacked, which has the extra markup to handle stacked mode (specifically for generating the cell headings):

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableSimpleStacked.vue#template{vue-html}

Like `BTable` and `BTableLite`, table headers (`<thead>`) and footers (`<tfoot>`) are visually hidden when the table is visually stacked. If you need a header or footer, you can do so by creating an extra `BTr` inside of the `BTbody` component (or in a second `BTbody` component), and set a role of columnheader on the child `BTh` cells, and use Bootstrap v5 responsive display utility classes to hide the extra row (or `BTbody`) above a certain breakpoint when the table is no longer visually stacked (the breakpoint should match the stacked table breakpoint you have set), i.e. `<BTr class="d-md-none">` would hide the row on medium and wider screens, while `<BTbody class="d-md-none">` would hide the row group on medium and wider screens.

::: info NOTE
Note: stacked mode with `BTableSimple` requires that you use the BootstrapVueNext [table helper components](#table-helper-components).
Use of the regular `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<td>` and `<th>` element tags will not work as expected, nor will they automatically apply any of the required accessibility attributes.
:::

### Simple tables and sticky columns

Sticky columns are supported with `BTableSimple`, but you will need to set the sticky-column prop on each table cell (in the thead, tbody, and tfoot row groups) in the column that is to be sticky. For example:

<<< FRAGMENT ./demo/TableSimpleSticky.vue#template{vue-html}

As with `BTable` and `BTableLite`, sticky columns are not supported when the stacked prop is set on `BTableSimple`.
