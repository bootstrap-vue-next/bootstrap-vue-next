# Tables

<PageHeader>

For displaying tabular data, `BTable` supports pagination, filtering, sorting, custom rendering, various style options, events, and asynchronous data. For simple display of tabular data without all the fancy features, BootstrapVueNext provides two lightweight alternative components [`BTableLite`](light-weight-tables) and [`BTableSimple`](simple-tables).

</PageHeader>

## Basic Usage

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableOverview.vue

## Items (record data)

`items` is the table data in array format, where each record (row) data are keyed objects. Example
format:

<<< FRAGMENT ./demo/TableItems.ts#snippet{ts}

`<BTable>` automatically samples the first row to extract field names (the keys in the record
data). Field names are automatically "humanized" by converting `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, and
`camelCase` to individual words and capitalizes each word. Example conversions:

- `first_name` becomes `First Name`
- `last-name` becomes `Last Name`
- `age` becomes `Age`
- `YEAR` remains `YEAR`
- `isActive` becomes `Is Active`

These titles will be displayed in the table header, in the order they appear in the **first** record
of data. See the [Fields](#fields-column-definitions) section below for customizing how field
headings appear.

::: info NOTE
Field order is not guaranteed. Fields will typically appear in the order they were defined
in the first row, but this may not always be the case depending on the version of browser in use.
See section [Fields (column definitions)](#fields-column-definitions) below to see how to guarantee
the order of fields, and to override the headings generated.
:::

Record data may also have additional special reserved name keys for colorizing rows and individual
cells (variants), and for triggering additional row detail. The type [TableItem](/docs/types#tableitem)
defines the supported optional item record modifier properties
(make sure your field keys do not conflict with these names):

| Property        | Type                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_cellVariants` | Partial<Record<keyof T, ColorVariant>> | Bootstrap contextual state applied to individual cells. Keyed by field (See the [Color Variants](/docs/reference/color-variants) for supported values). These variants map to classes `table-${variant}` or `bg-${variant}` (when the `dark` prop is set). |
| `_rowVariant`   | ColorVariant                           | Bootstrap contextual state applied to the entire row (See the [Color Variants](/docs/reference/color-variants) for supported values). These variants map to classes `table-${variant}` or `bg-${variant}` (when the `dark` prop is set)                    |
| `_showDetails`  | boolean                                | Used to trigger the display of the `row-details` scoped slot. See section [Row details support](#row-details-support) below for additional information                                                                                                     |

### Example: Using variants for table cells

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableCellVariants.vue

`items` can also be a reference to a _provider_ function, which returns an `Array` of items data.
Provider functions can also be asynchronous:

- By returning `null` (or `undefined`) and calling a callback, when the data is ready, with the data
  array as the only argument to the callback,
- By returning a `Promise` that resolves to an array.

See the ["Using Items Provider functions"](#using-items-provider-functions) section below for more
details.

### Table item notes and warnings

- Avoid manipulating record data in place, as changes to the underlying items data will cause either
  the row or entire table to be re-rendered. See [Primary Key](#primary-key), below, for ways to
  minimize Vue's re-rendering of rows.
- `items` array records should be a simple object and **must** avoid placing data that may have
  circular references in the values within a row. `<BTable>` serializes the row data into strings
  for sorting and filtering, and circular references will cause stack overflows to occur and your
  app to crash!

## Fields (column definitions)

The `fields` prop is used to customize the table columns headings, and in which order the columns of
data are displayed. The field object keys (i.e. `age` or `first_name` as shown below) are used to
extract the value from each item (record) row, and to provide additional features such as enabling
[sorting](#sorting) on the column, etc.

Fields can be provided as a _simple array_ or an _array of objects_. **Internally the fields data
will be normalized into the _array of objects_ format**. Events or slots that include the column
`field` data will be in the normalized field object format (array of objects for `fields`, or an
object for an individual `field`).

### Fields as a simple array

Fields can be a simple array, for defining the order of the columns, and which columns to display:

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableFieldArray.vue

### Fields as an array of objects

Fields can be a an array of objects, providing additional control over the fields (such as sorting,
formatting, etc.). Only columns (keys) that appear in the fields array will be shown:

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableFieldObjects.vue

### Field Definition Reference

The following field properties (defined as [TableField](/docs/types#tableitem)) are recognized:

| Property            | Type                                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Notes:**

- Field properties, if not present, default to `null` (falsey) unless otherwise stated above.
- `class`, `thClass`, `tdClass` etc. will not work with classes that are defined in scoped CSS,
  unless you are using Vue's

## Primary Key

`<BTable>` provides an additional prop `primary-key`, which you can use to identify the _name_ of
the field key that _uniquely_ identifies the row.

The value specified by the primary column key **must be** either a `string` or `number`, and **must
be unique** across all rows in the table.

The primary key column does not need to appear in the displayed fields.

### Table row ID generation

When provided, the `primary-key` will generate a unique ID for each item row `<tr>` element. The ID
will be in the format of `{table-id}__row_{primary-key-value}`, where `{table-id}` is the unique ID
of the `<BTable>` and `{primary-key-value}` is the value of the item's field value for the field
specified by `primary-key`.

### Table render and transition optimization

The `primary-key` is also used by `<BTable>` to help Vue optimize the rendering of table rows.
Internally, the value of the field key specified by the `primary-key` prop is used as the Vue `:key`
value for each rendered item row `<tr>` element.

If you are seeing rendering issue (i.e. tooltips hiding or unexpected subcomponent re-usage when
item data changes or data is sorted/filtered/edited) or table row transitions are not working,
setting the `primary-key` prop (if you have a unique identifier per row) can alleviate these issues.

Specifying the `primary-key` column is handy if you are using 3rd party table transitions or drag
and drop plugins, as they rely on having a consistent and unique per row `:key` value.

If `primary-key` is not provided, `<BTable>` will auto-generate keys based on the displayed row's
index number (i.e. position in the _displayed_ table rows). This may cause GUI issues such as sub
components/elements that are rendering with previous results (i.e. being re-used by Vue's render
patch optimization routines). Specifying a `primary-key` column can alleviate this issue (or you can
place a unique `:key` on your element/components in your custom formatted field slots).

Refer to the [Table body transition support](#table-body-transition-support) section for additional
details.

## Sorting

As mentioned in the [Fields](#fields) section above, you can make columns
sortable in `<BTable>`. Clicking on a sortable column header will sort the column in ascending
direction (smallest first), while clicking on it again will switch the direction of sorting to
descending (largest first). Clicking on it a third time will stop sorting on the column. For
single column sorting (e.g. `multisort===false`) clicking on a differnt sortable column header will
sort that column in ascending order and clear the sort order for the previously sorted column.

You can control which column is pre-sorted and the order of sorting (ascending or descending). To
pre-specify the column to be sorted use the `sortBy` model. For single column sorting (e.g. `multisort===false`)
`sortBy` should be an array containing a single `BTableSortBy` object.

<<< FRAGMENT ./demo/TableSortBy.ts#snippet{ts}

- **Ascending**: Items are sorted lowest to highest (i.e. `A` to `Z`) and will be displayed with the
  lowest value in the first row with progressively higher values in the following rows.
- **Descending**: Items are sorted highest to lowest (i.e. `Z` to `A`) and will be displayed with
  the highest value in the first row with progressively lower values in the following rows.

By default the comparer function does a `numeric localeCompare`. If one wishes to change this, use a custom comparer function with that `BTableSortBy` element.

To prevent the table from wiping out the comparer function, internally it will set the `order` key to `undefined`, instead of just removing the element from the `sortBy` array. i.e. `:sort-by="[]"` & `:sort-by="[key: 'someKey', order: undefined]"` behave identically. Naturally if this value is given to a server, orders of undefined should be handled.

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableSort.vue

`sorbBy` is a [named model](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/v-model.html#multiple-v-model-bindings)
so it can be bound to an object that will be updated with the current sort state when the user changes
sorting by clicking the headers.

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableSortBy.vue

Tables can be sorted by multiple columns. Programmaticly, this can be done by adding more entries
to the `sortBy` array. From the user inteface, multi-sort works as follows:

- Clicking on a sortable header that isn't currently sorted adds it as `ascending` to the end of the sortBy list
- Clicking on a sortable header that is currently sorted as ascending makes it **descending**, but leaves it in the same order in the `sortBy` list
- Clicking on a sortable header that is currently sorted as descending will set the order to undefined. If `must-sort` is `true` OR if `mustSort` is an array that contains that columns `key`, it will skip to be `ascending`

## Simple tables

The `BTableSimple` component gives the user complete control over the rendering of the table content, while providing basic Bootstrap v5 table styling. `BTableSimple` is a wrapper component around the `<table>` element. Inside the component, via the default slot, you can use any or all of the BootstrapVueNext table helper components: `BThead`, `BTfoot`, `BTbody`, `BTr`, `BTh`, `BTd`, and the HTML5 elements `<caption>`, `<colgroup>` and `<col>`. Contrary to the component's name, one can create simple or complex table layouts with `BTableSimple`.

`BTableSimple` provides basic styling options via props: striped, bordered, borderless, outlined, small, hover, dark, fixed, responsive and sticky-header. Note that stacked mode is available but requires some additional markup to generate the cell headings, as described in the Simple tables and stacked mode section below. Sticky columns are also supported, but also require a bit of additional markup to specify which columns are to be sticky. See below for more information on using sticky columns.

Since b-table-simple is just a wrapper component, of which you will need to render content inside, it does not provide any of the advanced features of `BTable` (i.e. row events, head events, sorting, pagination, filtering, foot-clone, items, fields, etc.).

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableSimpleOverview.vue#template{vue-html}

When in responsive or sticky-header mode, the `<table>` element is wrapped inside a `<div>` element. If you need to apply additional classes or attributes to the `<table>` element, use the table-classes and table-attrs, respectively.

### Simple tables and stacked mode

A bit of additional markup is required on your `BTableSimple` body cells when the table is in stacked mode. Specifically, BootstrapVueNext uses a special data attribute to create the cell's heading, of which you can supply to `BTd` or `BTh` via the stacked-heading prop. Only plain strings are supported (not HTML markup), as we use the pseudo element ::before and css content property.

Here is the same table as above, set to be always stacked, which has the extra markup to handle stacked mode (specifically for generating the cell headings):

<<< DEMO ./demo/TableSimpleStacked.vue#template{vue-html}

Like `BTable` and `BTableLite`, table headers (`<thead>`) and footers (`<tfoot>`) are visually hidden when the table is visually stacked. If you need a header or footer, you can do so by creating an extra `BTr` inside of the `BTbody` component (or in a second `BTbody` component), and set a role of columnheader on the child `BTh` cells, and use Bootstrap v5 responsive display utility classes to hide the extra row (or `BTbody`) above a certain breakpoint when the table is no longer visually stacked (the breakpoint should match the stacked table breakpoint you have set), i.e. `<BTr class="d-md-none">` would hide the row on medium and wider screens, while `<BTbody class="d-md-none">` would hide the row group on medium and wider screens.

::: info NOTE
Note: stacked mode with `BTableSimple` requires that you use the BootstrapVueNext [table helper components](#table-helper-components).
Use of the regular `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<td>` and `<th>` element tags will not work as expected, nor will they automatically apply any of the required accessibility attributes.
:::

### Simple tables and sticky columns

Sticky columns are supported with `BTableSimple`, but you will need to set the sticky-column prop on each table cell (in the thead, tbody, and tfoot row groups) in the column that is to be sticky. For example:

<<< FRAGMENT ./demo/TableSimpleSticky.vue#template{vue-html}

As with `BTable` and `BTableLite`, sticky columns are not supported when the stacked prop is set on `BTableSimple`.
