# Collapse

<div class="lead mb-5">

Easily toggle visibility of almost any content on your pages in a vertically collapsing container.
Includes support for making accordions. Visibility can be easily toggled with our
[`v-b-toggle` directive](/docs/directives/BToggle), or via [`v-model`](#v-model-support).

</div>

<<< DEMO ./demo/CollapseOverview.vue#template{vue-html}

## Usage

Other elements can easily toggle `BCollapse` components using the
[`v-b-toggle` directive](/docs/directives/toggle).

<<< DEMO ./demo/CollapseUsage.vue#template{vue-html}

## Initial visibility (start expanded)

To make the `BCollapse` show initially, set the `v-model` prop:

<<< DEMO ./demo/CollapseInitial.vue#template{vue-html}

## `v-model` support

The component's collapsed (visible) state can also be set with `v-model` which binds internally to
the `visible` prop.

Note, when using `v-model` to control `BCollapse`, the `aria-*` attributes and class `collapsed`
are not automatically placed on the trigger button (as is the case when using the `v-b-toggle`
directive). In this example we **must control the attributes ourselves** for proper accessibility
support.

By default, an initially visible collapse will not animate on mount. To enable the collapse expanding animation on mount,
set the `toggle` prop on `<BCollapse>` and leave the `visible` prop as false.

<<< DEMO ./demo/CollapseModel.vue

## Trigger multiple collapse elements

You can even collapse multiple `BCollapse` components via a single `v-b-toggle` by providing
multiple target Ids using _modifiers_.

You can also pass multiple target Ids via the directive _value_ in BootstrapVueNext.

<<< DEMO ./demo/CollapseMultiple.vue#template{vue-html}

## Slots

The `header` and `footer` slots can be used to create custom toggles for your collapsible content. The default slot is
used for the content to be hidden or shown.

Using the `v-b-toggle` directive to toggle the `BCollapse` will still work but the `collapsed` CSS class will no longer be applied to the element with the directive.

The following properties are available for the `header` and `footer` and `default` slots:

| Property  | Type     | Description                           |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `visible` | Boolean  | Visible state of the collapse         |
| `toggle`  | Function | When called, will toggle the collapse |
| `show`    | Function | When called, will open the collapse   |
| `hide`    | Function | When called, will close the collapse  |
| `id`      | String   | The ID of the collapsible element     |

`BCollapse` also [provides](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/provide-inject.html) the above variables
to its children as well as the value of the `isNav` prop.

<<< DEMO ./demo/CollapseContent.vue#template{vue-html}

## Exposed functions

`BCollapse` exposes several functions and properties that allow manipulation and examination of the state of the components.
These are accessed through the [template ref](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html#template-refs)

- hide: Hides the collapse and fires the `hide` event
- show: Shows the collapse and fires the `show` event
- toggle: Toggles the collapse and fires the `hide` or `show` event, as appropriate
- isNav: The value of the `isNav` prop of the collapse
- visible: The visible state of the collapse

<<< DEMO ./demo/CollapseExpose.vue

## Accessibility

The `v-b-toggle` directive will automatically add the ARIA attributes `aria-controls` and
`aria-expanded` to the component that the directive appears on (as well as add the class `collapsed`
when not expanded). `aria-expanded` will reflect the state of the target `BCollapse` component,
while `aria-controls` will be set to the Id(s) of the target `BCollapse` component(s).

If using `v-model` to set the visible state instead of the directive `v-b-toggle`, you will be
required to, on the toggle element, add the `aria-controls` and other appropriate attributes and
classes yourself.

While the `v-b-toggle` directive can be placed on almost any HTML element or Vue component, it is
recommended to use a button or link (or similar component) to act as your toggler; otherwise your
trigger elements may be inaccessible to keyboard or screen reader users. If you do place them on
something other than a button or link (or similar component), you should add the attributes
`tabindex="0"` and `role="button"` to allow users of assistive technology to reach your trigger
element.
