  <BAccordion flush>
    <BAccordionItem title="Accordion Item #1">
      Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate the
      <code>flush</code> property. This is the first item's accordion body.
    </BAccordionItem>
    <BAccordionItem title="Accordion Item #2">
      Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate the
      <code>flush</code> property. This is the second item's accordion body. Let's imagine this
      being filled with some actual content.
    </BAccordionItem>
    <BAccordionItem title="Accordion Item #3">
      Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate the
      <code>flush</code> property. This is the third item's accordion body. Nothing more exciting
      happening here in terms of content, but just filling up the space to make it look, at least at
      first glance, a bit more representative of how this would look in a real-world application.
