## Benefits

- **IDE autocomplete** - Your editor suggests valid field names as you type
- **Compile-time validation** - Typos and invalid field names are caught before runtime
- **Type inference** - The `v-model` type is automatically inferred from your value field
- **Refactoring safety** - Renaming fields in your interface updates all usages
